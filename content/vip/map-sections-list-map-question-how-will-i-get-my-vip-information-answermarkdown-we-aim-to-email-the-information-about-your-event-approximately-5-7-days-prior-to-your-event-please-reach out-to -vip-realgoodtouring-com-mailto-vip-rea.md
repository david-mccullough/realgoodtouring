      we are unable to ship any to guests who miss their event.
  - question: Can I bring gifts for the creators to the VIP program?
    answerMarkdown: Due to space constraints in our trailers and vans, COVID, and
      the timing of our programs, we are not always able to accommodate storing

      that guests refrain from bringing gifts, or email us in advance to confirm
      gifts are allowed for your particular tour.

      access to any ticketing platforms and are unable to give refunds or

      As long as you and your friends are all arriving at the same time, they
      will be able to scan in with you! If you and your friends are arriving at
      different times, please
      contact [vip@realgoodtouring.​com](mailto:vip@realgoodtouring.com) so we
      can make a note on your order for the check in staff. You will need to
      transfer your tickets with your friends, which is generally detailed on
      any platform you purchased tickets through's FAQ.


      Please note: if you transfer a ticket because you are arriving at different times, your name is still listed on the VIP list. You must email [vip@realgoodtouring.com](mailto:vip@realgoodtouring.com) ​to make a note that a guest other than you will be checking in. **If their name is not on the list, they will not be permitted entry with the VIP program.** Their ticket will only allow them in for the general admission portion of the event.
